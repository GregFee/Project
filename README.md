**Project - Programming and Scripting Iris Data Set**

Introduction: This project will explore Fisher's Iris Data Set (1936)(1) This is an example of discriminate analysis and the data set conists of fifty samples from each of three Iris flowers including the setosa, virginica and versicolor type(1). There are 150 observations in the set. Performance on the data set is a standard bearer for new proposed machine learning(2). This project will analyse the data from 150 observations in relation to petal length/width and sepal length/width.


Installing: *Download and install Anaconda to run this code. https://www.anaconda.com/

Version used 3.6.3 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Oct 15 2017, 03:27:45) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)]

Download and save dataset from  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris. File to be saved as iris.csv into same folder as code is executed from


Procedure:

The project can be run from the iris.py file

1. The maximun and minimum of each column of data was calculated.
2. The mean for each column of data is calculated.
3. A historgram is presented for each measurement category.
4. A simple plot was made for each data category.
5. A plot will was made to show two data catergories running concurrently
6. Scatter plots are presented for the data cetergories. 
7. Box Plots were created to show distribution.

The summary of this project is the Summary file in this repository.
